ED : Environment Descriptor
======

## Introduction

ED is a 3D geometric, object-based world representation for robots.

## Installation

**Note: Currently only ROS Hydro is supported ** 

We assume you have successfully installed ROS and set-up a Catkin workspace. Check out the following packages in your workspace:

    cd <your_catkin_workspace>/src

    git clone https://github.com/tue-robotics/ed.git
    git clone https://github.com/tue-robotics/tue_filesystem
    git clone https://github.com/tue-robotics/geolib2
    git clone https://github.com/tue-robotics/code_profiler
    git clone https://github.com/tue-robotics/tue_config.git
    git clone https://github.com/tue-robotics/ed_object_models.git
    git clone https://github.com/tue-robotics/tue_serialization
    git clone https://github.com/tue-robotics/rgbd
    
You will also need the following system dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-visualization-msgs ros-hydro-geometry-msgs ros-hydro-pcl-ros ros-hydro-message-filters ros-hydro-image-geometry ros-hydro-kdl-parser libyaml-dev ros-hydro-roslib ros-hydro-navigation ros-hydro-std-srvs ros-hydro-cv-bridge ros-hydro-tf libassimp-dev ros-hydro-message-generation ros-hydro-roscpp ros-hydro-message-runtime ros-hydro-class-loader ros-hydro-pcl-conversions
    
This should be sufficient to successfully compile ED:

    cd <your_catkin_workspace>
    catkin_make
    
## Quick Start

ED strongly relies on plugins to integrate sensor data, estimate object positions, recognize objects, etc. Before you can start ED, you have to specify the location of these plugins using the environment variable ED_PLUGIN_PATH. For example, for a ROS Catkin workspace, the variable should be set to something like:

    export ED_PLUGIN_PATH=<your_catkin_workspace>/devel/lib
    
You can provide multiple paths by seperating them using ':'.

You can then start ED by running:

    rosrun ed ed_server
