ED : Environment Descriptor [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tue-robotics/ed.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tue-robotics/ed)
======

## Introduction

ED - Environment Description - is a 3D geometric, object-based world representation system for robots. At the moment different ED modules exist which enable robots to localize themselves, update positions of known objects based on recent sensor data, segment and store newly encountered objects and visualize all this through a web-based GUI.

### Why use ED?

* ED is **one re-usable environment description** that can be used for a multitude of needed functionalities. Instead of having different environment representations for localization, navigation, manipulation, interaction, etc, you now only need *one*. An improvement in this single, central world model will reflect in the performances of the separate robot capabilities.
* ED is an **object-based, geometrical world representation**. As opposed to occupancy grids, octomaps, high-density monolithic meshes and the like, ED allows the user to use object-based, semantic statements such as 'inspect the objects on top of the table' or to 'navigate to the couch', while the geometrical representation allows the robot to still avoid obstacles - known and unknown - that it encounters on its path.
* The world geometry and objects can easily be specified with a set of easily accessible **human-readable files, re-usable models, heightmaps, primitives**, etc.
* ED has a **plugin system**. In itself, ED is 'just' a data structure containing a world representation. Functionality is added through plugins, which run concurrently and query and update the world model in a thread-safe manner. This makes the system **easily extendable**.
* ED's default **localization** module consists of a fast particle filter implementation and sensor models which always take into account the most recent state of the world. This means that if the world representation improves while the robot is running, localization becomes better. The localization module is more efficient and accurate than the well-known [AMCL-module](http://wiki.ros.org/amcl) and *no* separate occupancy grid is needed.
* The *sensor_integration* module enables **object updates**: using data from a depth sensor such as the Kinect, positions of known objects, such as pieces of furniture, can be updated. This allows the robot to successfully interact with its environment, even if the world model specified by the user contains errors.
* The *sensor_integration* module also enables **object segmentation**: the geometrical knowledge about the world enables fast, reliable and efficient object segmentation. This enables the robot to "find all objects on top of the table" or "inside the cabinet".
* Though not yet released, ED has modules for **real-time, on-line generation of costmaps** that can be used directly by existing **navigation modules** such as [MoveBase](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base). Whenever the world model representation changes, the costmaps will instantly reflect the change.
* ED can be visualized using a **web-based GUI**. This enables users to monitor the state of the world using a large variety of systems, including PC's, smart phones and tables.

## Tutorial

### Running ED with a configuration file

Requirements:
* Installed ED, ED localization and ED visualization (see above)

ED strongly relies on plugins to integrate sensor data, estimate object positions, recognize objects, etc. Before you can start ED, you have to specify the location of these plugins using the environment variable ED_PLUGIN_PATH. For example, for a ROS Catkin workspace, the variable should be set to something like:

    export ED_PLUGIN_PATH=<your_catkin_workspace>/devel/lib

You can provide multiple paths by separating them using ':'.

You can then start ED by running:

    rosrun ed ed

This will start the ED server which holds the world data structure. However, no world data is loaded, so the ED instance is quite useless at the moment. The world data that should be loaded and the plugins that should be started can be specified in a *configuration file*. Then, it's simply a matter of running ED like this:

    rosrun ed ed CONFIG-FILE

The configuration file should be written in a [YAML-format](www.yaml.org) and mainly consists of two parts: a world specification, and a list of plugins. The first determines what the world looks like, the second what we want to do with the world representation. Create a file called 'my-ed-config.yaml' and put this in:

    world:
    - id: block1
      pose: { x: 2, y: 0, z: 0.5 }
      shape:
        box:
          size: { x: 0.5, y: 0.5, z: 1 }
    - id: block2
      pose: { x: 3, y: 2, z: 0.75 }
      shape:
        box:
          size: { x: 0.5, y: 0.5, z: 1.5 }

    plugins:
      - name: gui_server
        lib: libed_gui_server_plugin.so


Take some time to try to understand what the config file states. A world is specified consisting of two objects - we'll call these entities. Both entities have an ID, a position in the world, and a shape. The shape is described as being a box with a certain size. Furthermore, we specify that we want to run the gui_server plugin. This will allow us to visualize the world in RViz.

Now, run ED using the configuration file we created above:

    rosrun ed ed my-ed-config.yaml

You probably won't see a lot happening. But ED *is* running. To visualize the world we have described, we need to run another node. This is some sort of proxy which communicates over a low-bandwidth channel with the ED GUI server plugin and generates visualization markers, which are typically high-bandwidth. This is useful: when running ED on the robot, make sure you run the proxy on a local machine. The local machine will communicate with the robot over a low-bandwidth topic, while RViz will 'listen' to the high-bandwidth visualization markers which are produced on the same local machine. To run the proxy:

    rosrun ed_gui_server ed_rviz_publisher

Now start RViz, and listen to the Marker topic '/ed/rviz'. You should see two blocks appearing: the blocks you specified in the configuration file.

### Specifying a more complex world

So far, we have created a configuration file which tells ED to create a world consisting of two blocks, and running a plugin which helps visualizing this world in RViz. That's nice, but not very useful. We need to create a model of the world the robot is living in, and that will be a bit more work than just adding a couple of boxes. Fortunately, ED allows you to use quite some powerful expressions to create the shapes you need. On of those is particularly useful if you already have a 2D map of the robots' environment: the height map. If you have used some sort of SLAM method (e.g., http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping) to create a 2D occupancy map of the environment, then you can almost directly use this map to specify the shape of an entity in ED.

We assume you have created a 2D occupancy map using [ROS' GMapping](http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping) and used the map saver from [ROS map server](http://wiki.ros.org/map_server) to store the map. This will leave you with two files: a PGM image file containing the occupancy grid and a YAML-file with the meta-data. The image file has white pixels for all non-occupied cells, and black pixels for occupied cells. The meta-data contains the origin of the map, and the resolution.

In some simple steps, these two files can be converted to an ED world specification:

1. Copy or move the PGM-file to the same directory in which you stored the 'my-ed-config.yaml' configuration file, and call it 'my-walls.pgm'.
2. Open the map with your favorite image editor (e.g., Gimp). Make sure all gray pixels (which are 'unknowns' in the map) are changed into white. You should only have black and white pixels.
3. Take a look at the map's YAML file. Remember the 'resolution' and 'origin' fields
4. Change 'my-ed-config.yaml' to the following:


    world:
    - id: walls
      shape:
        heightmap:
          image: $(file my-walls.pgm)
          height: 2
          resolution: 0.025
          pose: { x: -10.0, y: -10.0, z: 0 }

    plugins:
      - name: gui_server
        lib: libed_gui_server_plugin.so

**Note that you have to put the correct values in the 'resolution' and 'pose' field (as found in the map YAML file in step 3).**

That's it! This config file tells ED that it should load the heightmap from the specified 'my-walls.pgm' image. The 'height' field specifies how high the walls have to be.

Now, it is important to know that:

1. You do not necessarily need GMapping to do this. You can use any other SLAM-method, or simply draw the heightmap yourself! Often, we (the authors of this tutorial) start with a SLAM-created map, but clean it up and reduce it until only the walls are left.
2. This is more than a 2D occupancy grid. We only used black and white pixels in the example above, but any gray value can be used. The 'blackness' of a pixel defines it's height: black is the highest, white is floor-level, but you can specify anything in between.

To visualize the world model specified in the config file above, simply run ED and the ed_rviz_publisher again, and use RViz.

    rosrun ed ed my-ed-config.yaml
    rosrun ed_gui_server ed_rviz_publisher
